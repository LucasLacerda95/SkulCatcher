**#Apprenticeship**

**During the creation of the game, several principles of programming in C were used, among them are functions, matrices, pointers, loops of repetition etc.**


**#Conclusion**

**It was an extremely worthwhile experience to practice with a procedural language, where we have to do all the processes by hand and not rely on ready-made functions.
In addition, as it is a medium-level language, it facilitates the understanding of how variables are allocated in the machine's memory, for example, and in other processes as well.**
